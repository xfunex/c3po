clone of http://github.com/progrium/protocol-droid with these differences:

- xmpp sending works
- much more poorly written, blocks on network calls sometimes
- takes user URIs and looks up their actual contact info in FOAF

My API:

    POST /
      user={foaf uri}
      msg={text}
      mode={email|xmpp|sms}
        
If you don't like foaf, just pass the appopriate address for the
message mode, such as 
  mode=email&user=drewp@example.com
  mode=xmpp&user=drewp@jabber.example.com
  mode=sms&user=6505551234@sms.example.com

The SMS mode sends your message as the from-line of the email, which
looked pretty good on my Palm Pre.
